In this project, I created a program that creates a container class people that holds an array of 20 person objects. The program uses the container class people to store the contents of an input. This class uses dynamic memory allocation and cleans up memory when it is destroyed.  

This uses the previous project (Person-C) and further updates it based on the instructions.

This project was for my introduction to programming II class at university. Using my knowledge from class, I implemented the necessary algorithms/code. I also used my course materials (lecture slides and textbooks) and advice from the professor.

When inserting an item to the array, I determined where the item should go, and shifted the rest of the array to make room. This is better than just appending it to the end and sorting it as that is less efficient.
